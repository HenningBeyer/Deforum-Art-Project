# Deforum_Art_Project

This is a simple project for an art homework given in school about 'Your Future in n Years' in which a Stable Diffusion model is used for creating a fluent 2D and 3D animation. It took mainly a lot of reasearching effort and time to get to the fitting parameter setting on the a public notebook called ('Deforum_Stable_Diffusion.ipynb')[https://colab.research.google.com/github/deforum-art/deforum-stable-diffusion/blob/main/Deforum_Stable_Diffusion.ipynb] as well as for getting the right camera movement and noise schedules.

Some notes, useful sources and researched artist styles find themselves scattered in the notebook in a similar way as the written prompt text of +500 words in which I tried to tell the story of a man studying physics and getting older. When he approaches his death he experiences parts of his earlier life in a very symbolic fashion before even death reaches up to him in his last dreams.

It took about 18 hours to render in Colab and about 40 hours to prepare the notebook. Shotcut as a video editing software was very handy for upscaling to 4k and interpolating to 180 fps in 20 min.
