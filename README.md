# Deforum_Art_Project

This is a simple project for an art homework given in school about 'Your Future in n Years' in which a Stable Diffusion model is used for creating a fluent 2D and 3D animation. It took mainly a lot of reasearching effort and time to get to the fitting parameter setting on the a public notebook called ('Deforum_Stable_Diffusion.ipynb')[https://colab.research.google.com/github/deforum-art/deforum-stable-diffusion/blob/main/Deforum_Stable_Diffusion.ipynb] as well as for getting the right camera movement and noise schedules. Please open these notebooks in (Google Colab)[https://colab.research.google.com/] where the notebook style is not as broken.

Some notes, useful sources and researched artist styles are scattered in the notebook with the written prompts  of +500 words. The depicted story should represent a man studying physics and getting older. When he approaches his death he experiences parts of his earlier life which are purely rendered by an AI.

It took about 18 hours to render in Colab and about 40 hours to prepare the notebook. Shotcut as a video editing software was very handy for upscaling to 4k and interpolating to 180 fps in 20 min.
